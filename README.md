# Deserted-Game  
## About the Project  
This demo is similar to the Adobe Flash version I created found here: http://www.paigepeck.com/deserted/, but this version has more features and better handling of player's ship. It is designed using the Allegro game library found here: http://liballeg.org/. 

This version currently only has the player's ship and two different weapon sets. A system for adjusting the player's shield strength, weapon abilities, and engine power is a new feature. After enough power in one system, a special ability is made available. 


## Building Project  
###1. INSTALL VISUAL C++ EXPRESS (FROM MICROSOFT WEB SITE)
First, install the Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition 2010.
###2. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL ALLEGRO (FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2010)
Next, you will need to install the correct Allegro library files for your compiler.  The version you need to install is Allegro version 5.0.10, or a later version if available. Unzip the allegro-5.0.7-msvc-10.0.zip file to gain access to the Allegro library files.  This will yield three directories:  bin, include and lib.  Each one contains files that you need to copy to appropriate directories.  In previous versions the files were copied directly into the compiler's subdirectories.  However, now the strong suggestion is to copy them to an easily-discoverable directory elsewhere.  I strongly suggest you create a separate directory in your root directory called Allegro, and then use that as the location for all of the library files.  Here is the path as it exists on my hard drive: C:\Allegro

Now, you need to copy everything from the above mentioned binary package into their proper locations.  I recommend you copy all of the directories, not move them.  If you move them, you can easily lose track of exactly what files you moved, and if they end up in the wrong folder, you have a problem!  Simply copy all three folders into your new Allegro directory.  Note that the include directory has a number of other directories inside it.  You want to keep that intact, so again just copy everything.  When you are done, the compiler will be able to find what it needs with a few project settings, which we will cover next.  Just to help make this clear, here is the final directory setup on my hard drive:
C:\Allegro\bin C:\Allegro\include C:\Allegro\lib
(And again the include directory has a bunch of directories within it.)
###3. TESTING ALLEGRO WITH A REAL PROJECT
Start up the Visual Studio 2010 compiler.  Now, create a new empty solution and project:
Ø  File, New, Project… Ø  In the New Project dialog box, enter or select the following settings: o   In the templates column, under Visual C++ select the Win32 template and then "Win32 Project". o   Change the project name to Test Project, and the solution name to Test Solution (or more appropriate names). o   Leave Create directory for solution checked.  Browse to the folder that you want to create your solutions o   Click OK. o   In the Win32 Application Wizard that appears, click on "Application Settings", and select "Empty project".  (If that wizard does not appear, then you made a mistake in creating the project.) o   Press Finish to create the empty solution and project.

Next, create a source code file.  In case you forgot how to do that, here are some explicit instructions:
Ø  the Solution Explorer window, right-click on Source Files, and select Add, New Item…. Ø  In the Add New Item dialog box, select the Code category and the C++ File (.cpp) template, and enter a good name for your code, like Test Program. Ø  Click Add and you will have a blank file called Test Program.cpp in which to write your program.

Ø  From the menus, select Project, Properties.  You should see a dialog entitled Test Project Property Pages (or whatever project name you gave it) Ø  Click the > sign or + sign in front of Configuration Properties to open it (if you have to) Ø  Click the > sign or + sign in front of C/C++, and then click on General.  In the Additional Include Directories entry (which should be blank), add C:\Allegro\include Ø  In the Configuration Properties, select Linker, General.  In the Additional Library Directories, enter C:\Allegro\lib Ø  Again in Configuration Properties, select Linker, Input.  The first setting, Additional Dependencies has quite a few entries already.  We will add one more.  Click in front of the other entries and add the following file:  allegro-5.0.10-monolith-md-debug.lib, followed by a semicolon. Ø  Once more in Configuration Properties, select Debugging.  For the Environment setting, enter the following: PATH=C:\Allegro\bin;%PATH%   That results in adding that path to the PATH variable used in your system.  You could set this variable through your Control Panel, but the update needs to be made to each of your projects.  Ø  Click OK and the project settings are good to go.
