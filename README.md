# Deserted-Game  
This demo is similar to the Adobe Flash version I created found here: http://www.paigepeck.com/deserted/, but this version has more features and better handling of player's ship. It is designed using the Allegro game library found here: http://liballeg.org/. 

## Building Project  
To run this project, clone or download the repository. Follow along the "installAllegro.xps" instructions. I have included the necessary allegro zip that is listed. Once you have finished all these instructions, build and run the project.

## About the Project  
This version currently only has the player's ship and two different weapon sets. A system for adjusting the player's shield strengh, weapon abilities, and engine power is a new feature. After enough power in one system, a special ability is made available.
